#Tutorial for Uploading Github

### by Andrew Lee

##Why GitHub

GitHub is a web-based repository hosting service, which offers all of
the distributed revision control and source code management
functionality to Git.

At its core, the site not only has a code sharing and publishing
service, but also performs as a social networking site for programmers.

Therefore, unlike other version of server, GitHub manages and stores
reivisions of projects. Some people say it could be used to manage any
other type of file, such as Word documents. In a way one could think of
it as a filing cabinet for every draft of a document (or it could be
much better than Google’s gDrive!).

Here are the following commands and instructions to the GitHub
initializing.

##First, Convert a Document from Text to Markdown

What is Markdown? It is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
Markdown allows you to write using an “readable” text format, then
convert it to structurally valid HTML.

The goal of Mardown is to make text as readable as possible. The idea is
that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain
text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting
instructions.

Here’s some instructions for those with Babun software installed in PC:

1)  Open the babun (or in case of Mac, open a terminal)
2)  While you're running the babun, make a folder for yourself (e.g., a
    folder named "labnote").
3)  Then install pandoc, which is available for free in the Internet.
4)  Have a document in text format, which is ready for conversion (e.g.,
    a text file named "labnote\_week\_6.txt").


5.  In babun, type a following command for conversion: pandoc -so
    labnote\_week\_6.md labnote\_week\_6.txt
6.  Check your folder whether the file successfully converted into a
    Markdown format or not.

Now, the file is ready to go into your GitHub repository!

##Second, Upload a File to GitHub

Next, the file is ready to upload into one of your repository of GitHub
account. Here, the file is not only readable, but also ready for peer
review by collaborators at your choosing.

Here are commands from initializing GitHub to uploading the file:

1)  git init
2)  git remote add origin
    https://github.com/username/name-of-therepository (e.g.,
    https://github.com/andylee0427/labnotes)
3)  git push -u origin master
4)  git add labnote\_week\_6.md
5)  git status
6)  git commit -m "add labnote week 6"
7)  git push

As long as you follow in these steps, uploading files should be no
problem. If you want to use different repository to upload the file, use
the following command: git pull. Then you can use the similar command
above to do the same. If you still don't have a clue how to do it,
there's Google to search any type of command. Happy holiday!
